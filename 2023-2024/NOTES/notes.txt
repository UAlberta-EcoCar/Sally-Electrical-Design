PRESSURE SENSOR
- Range of pressures from -14.7 to 25 PSI
- Accepts power anywhere from 10-28VDC
- Consumes less than 10mA
- Output load 10k minimum (what does this mean?)
- Output voltage from 1-5VDC, must add resistor divider network and voltage buffer
- Device already has reverse polarity protection which is good because the dsub wiring could get mixed up

THERMISTOR
- Two wire thermistor
- Need to add a precision Vref and a user resistor to linearize the measurements
- If we can find a datasheet for it (maybe email ballard), we should be able to provide compensation in code
- Ballard specified so the range is probably all good
- User resistor should have high precision
