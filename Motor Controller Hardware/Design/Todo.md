# Todo

- [ ] Use ADCs to check capacitor voltages 
- [ ] LEDs for safe unsafe status and gate switching
- [x] Gate driver
- [ ] FOC Controller
- [ ] Power supply for digital chips
- [ ] G474 series for custom foc and other peripherals 
- [ ] use 2.5v high accuracy voltage refrence ( we use it beacuse the amp can only go up to 5V and cant go negative so we offset it by 2.5V wby using the refrence so that we can measure current going forwards and backwards the same amount.)
- [ ] Add 270uF caps per amp of coil current
- [ ] place leds in a cool arangement maybe a ccircle that represents the rotation of the motor. or along the side to make a cool animation to represnt the hyper drive
- [ ] add a beeper to indicate the power on.
- [ ] Add IO isolation on everything
- [ ] Figure out RTMI interface
- [ ] Add a SPI EEPROM speratly for Controller A and B
- [ ] Go through this document and implement the cutoff switch https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slva991a/slva991a.pdf?ts=1717129503448
- [ ] Go through this and check everything https://www.ti.com/lit/an/slvaf66/slvaf66.pdf?ts=1717067722270&ref_url=https%253A%252F%252Fwww.google.com%252F

- [ ] Use a RC Snubber to reduce ringing on phases or RCD clamp both optional.
- [ ] figure out a goot gate resistor value that minimizes the miller platoue
