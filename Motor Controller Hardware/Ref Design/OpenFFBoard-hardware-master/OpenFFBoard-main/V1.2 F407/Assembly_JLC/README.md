## FFBoard USB interface F407VG
This is the heart of the Open FFBoard.
It runs the FFBoard firmware and interfaces with all your peripherals and motor drivers.

#### Opening the schematics
The schematics, board layouts and part libraries are provided as EAGLE project files.
In theory you can also import the schematics and board with kicad.

#### Ordering fully assembled boards
The plan is to provide fully assembled kits later.

#### How to order yourself
You can order this board directly via [jlcpcb.com](https://jlcpcb.com/DYE).

The BOM and component placement files are available in the JLC assembly folder and already formatted with matching LCSC part numbers.

Everything apart from the headers can be directly assembled by JLC including the USB socket.
