# OpenFFBoard TMC4671 driver 1.2.2

Note: this is an experimental version for testing hall sensors. The 1.2 is shunt based.

Some parts may be difficult to source. The manufacturing files were made during a time where alternatives had to be found for some parts.

For the TMC1100 the SJ1 and SJ2 2.5V ref jumpers must be shorted. The LEM GO provides its own reference and the SJ1 and SJ2 must be left disconnected for best noise performance and C27 and C28 MUST be left blank!
