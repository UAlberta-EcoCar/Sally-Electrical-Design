# Issues Noticed at Competition

 - MQ 8 sensor was good but uncalibrated and no compensation curve was used.
 - Beeper was not used and I stupidly used a example from online and maybe the wrong mosfet to shift the voltage to 5v. Next time i should use just a regular mosfet. I gotta figure out why my pwm went down so bad like it wasnt even working i think something was pulling it down externally.
